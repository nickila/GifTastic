Coding Bootcamp Homework#6
This website allows users to search for gifs from the Giphy API.
The user can click a button to call ten gifs with the button's search term or they can create their own themed button to click on. Once the gifs load, the user can hover over it to see the title and rating. And if they click on the gif it will animate. If the user clicks again it will stop. Every time a button is clicked, the new set of gifs will load above the old ones but they will all be functional.

The design of the website was done by Brian Nickila.
The gifs are the property of the original creators.
API was through Giphy.
The website was created by Brian Nickila using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Bootstrap.
